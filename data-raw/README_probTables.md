Tables show per-gene probabilities of *de novo* variation
Probabilities are per chromosome, per generation.  To obtain probabilities for a cohort, multiply by 2 (to get diploid probability), then by the number of people in the population.
Unless otherwise indicates, probability tables are adjusted for typical exome sequencing coverage & mega-base scale inter-species divergence.


###
"fixed_mut_prob_fs_adjdepdiv"
original probability table from Samocha 2014
uses refseq transcripts
gene ids are ??

###
"hgnc_annotated_depthadj_pmuts_fs_canonical_transcripts_div_Feb07"
updated table
based on canonical Gencode transcripts
ENST is most precise ID
hgnc identifiers also provided for convenience
